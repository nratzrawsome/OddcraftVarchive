Living Armorstands<br>
{2020-2-25}<br>
----------<br>
A few people's armorstands near and within town, appear to of moved from the origonal positions they have been placed in. They appear to have mischivous intentions judging by their posture; <br>
such as holding up banners, looting chests, breaking down doors, etc.<br>
There is no evidence to who repositioned these armorstands, however they seem to have caused no major threat.<br>
