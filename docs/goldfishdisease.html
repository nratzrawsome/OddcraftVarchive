Goldfish Disease<br>
----------<br>
The Goldfish Disease became prominent after people started playing in groups. Coming near certain people result in your own skin being swapped with theirs, <br>
and vice versa. This disease occurs on the server side as result to a glitch; and it only applies on imported custom skins. Marketplace skins are safe from this disease.<br>
<br>
Although annoying, this disease is completely harmless. <br>
