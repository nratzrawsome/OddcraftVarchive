----------<br>
Flyerman is mostly passive. He often is seen swooping by, leaving paper flyers in his path, as well as throwing them at his "victems".<br>
The only potential crimes commited by this man is theft of sugarcane. He has not been spotted for a while, but if anyone spots him, please remember to thank him for the paper.<br>
